- Group together only naturally connected ideas that form one coherent thought.
- If a sentence expresses an internal emotion, confusion, or wandering thought, treat it as a valid item too.
- Do not add new information or make assumptions beyond what is written.
- Avoid excessive detail; only include what is present in the text.
- Do not use quotation marks or backslashes in the output.
- Respond in the same language as the input.
